# Background

I made this app while I was in Japan. I found myself in a Karaoke booth blanking out on what to sing, even though I had plenty of songs in my repertoire. I couldn't look them up online either due to reception issues.

I wanted to make a simple offline notes app for my songs that included a list of my songs, lyrics, and notes for what pitch settings to use.

A secondary goal was to test all the new AI advancements in App development and coding and see how fast one could release an app nowadays.

I tried out generic AI image generators for the initial design and then moved on to app UI-specific generators. UIZard, in particular, seemed very promising. However, except for some small inspirations, none replaced the need for a proper UI design, which I ended up doing in Figma.

For the coding part, I heavily used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These tools have increased my productivity by at least 50% and indirectly increased quality by freeing my mind to focus on putting the larger building blocks together.

With the help of AI coding tools, I was able to release this app on the App  Store within a week of conception. I'm looking forward to the future of software development. It is becoming more fun by the day.
